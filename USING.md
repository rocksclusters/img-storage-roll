# SDSC HPC Group Rocks® roll template

skeleton is a Rocks(r) roll template to be used as a starting point for the creation of new rolls.

Currently the only difference between this roll and the template generated by the Rocks(r) command...

	rocks create new roll name=skeleton

...is the inclusion of the `rename_roll.sh` script which can be used to rename directories and files as well as replace the content of the template files with the 'new' roll name.

Ultimately, more generic code will be added to the template to illustrate examples of how to include various types of Rocks(r) roll content and methods to pull 'source' packages for a roll from the Internet into the roll build tree.

*This file should be removed from any child repository created from it along with `gen_hash.sh` and `rename_roll.sh`.*
